### 30 Days of Code
#### Update (Apr 17, 2019)
I have been into development field for more than 2 years. I thought why shouldn't I give a shot to Competitive Programming.
So today I'm starting with **30 Days of Code** on Hackerrank platform. Everyday I'll solve at least 1 problem and push it here. Let's see how it goes... :heart_eyes: :sunglasses:


#### Update (Apr 20, 2019)
The problems were damn easy. It took me only 4 days to complete 30 Days of Code :wink: :relieved:

### Problem Solving
#### Update (Apr 22, 2019)
Time to increase the level of difficulty. Today, I am starting with Data Structure part in **Problem Solving** section of HackerRank. Like before, I'll solve at least a problem each day.
